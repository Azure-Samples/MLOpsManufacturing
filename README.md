# Overview

This project is based on and inspired by [MLOpsPython](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsPython).  It differs from MLOpsPython in the following ways:

* It supports image data instead of tabular data.
* It uses Tensorflow/Keras for model training instead of scikit learn.
* It has a separate data processing pipeline from the model training pipeline.
* It doesn't have batch scoring, A/B testing, or canary deployment.
